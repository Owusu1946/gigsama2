## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/keymap.git
   cd keymap
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your Gemini API key:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   REDIS_URL=your_redis_url_here
   JWT_SECRET=your_secure_jwt_secret_here
   ```

4. Run the development server
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Usage Flow

1. **Authentication:** Sign in or create a guest session
2. **Project Creation:** Create a new project or select an existing one
3. **Requirements Input:** Enter database requirements in natural language
4. **Conversational Refinement:** Engage with the AI to refine your schema
5. **Visualization:** View and interact with the generated schema in real-time
6. **Export & Share:** Download schema SQL/NoSQL or share your project via URL

## Architecture Highlights

### Frontend Architecture
The application follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- **Page Components:** Handle routing and layout
- **Feature Components:** Implement specific business logic
- **UI Components:** Reusable, presentational components
- **Custom Hooks:** Abstract complex logic and state management
- **Context Providers:** Manage global application state

### Backend Architecture
The API follows RESTful principles with a focus on:
- **Resource-based Routes:** Clear endpoint structure
- **Middleware Chain:** Authentication, validation, error handling
- **Service Layer:** Business logic separated from controllers
- **Data Access Layer:** Abstraction over storage implementation
- **Error Boundary:** Consistent error response format

### Data Flow
1. User actions trigger state updates and API calls
2. Optimistic UI updates provide immediate feedback
3. API calls validate and process data
4. Database operations are performed with proper error handling
5. Response confirms success or provides error details
6. UI updates based on server response

## Future Enhancements

- Team collaboration features with real-time updates
- Enhanced version control with diff visualization
- Code generation for multiple ORM frameworks
- Schema analysis and optimization suggestions
- Advanced visualization options with custom theming
- AI-powered database migration planning

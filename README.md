## Guest Mode: Transforming Database Design Accessibility

Our groundbreaking Guest Mode democratizes database schema design, eliminating traditional barriers to entry with a zero-friction starting experience:

### Instant Access, No Sign-up
Start designing your database schema immediately without registration, login forms, or email verification â€“ just like ChatGPT's guest experience. This removes all friction to trying the platform.

### Full-Featured Experience
Guest users enjoy the same powerful AI-driven schema design experience as registered users, including:
- Complete conversational AI capabilities
- Full schema generation and visualization
- Real-time typing indicators and response streaming
- Multi-format schema support (SQL & NoSQL)

### Seamless Continuation Path
While guest sessions don't persist data between visits, we offer:
- Clear prompts to create an account to save work
- One-click transition to registered accounts
- Project history and management for registered users

### Real-world Impact
This approach significantly lowers the barrier to entry for developers who need quick schema design assistance without commitment, much like how ChatGPT's guest mode revolutionized AI accessibility.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Owusu1964/gigsama2.git
   cd gigsama2
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your Gemini API key:
   ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
    keymap_KV_REST_API_TOKEN="your__token"
    keymap_KV_REST_API_URL="your_url"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

   ```

4. Run the development server
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Usage Flow

1. **Welcome Screen:** Start in either guest mode or sign in
2. **Project Creation:** Begin a conversation by describing your database needs
3. **Requirements Input:** Engage with the AI to describe your schema requirements
4. **Conversational Refinement:** Iterate and refine through back-and-forth conversation
5. **Schema Generation:** Ask the AI to "generate schema" when you're ready
6. **Visualization & Export:** View, modify, and export your schema in SQL or NoSQL format
7. **Save & Share:** Create an account to save your project or share via unique URL

## Architecture Highlights

### Frontend Architecture
The application follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- **Page Components:** Handle routing and layout
- **Feature Components:** Implement specific business logic
- **UI Components:** Reusable, presentational components
- **Custom Hooks:** Abstract complex logic and state management
- **Context Providers:** Manage global application state

### Backend Architecture
The API follows RESTful principles with a focus on:
- **Resource-based Routes:** Clear endpoint structure
- **Middleware Chain:** Authentication, validation, error handling
- **Service Layer:** Business logic separated from controllers
- **Data Access Layer:** Abstraction over storage implementation
- **Error Boundary:** Consistent error response format

### AI Integration Architecture
The AI integration is designed for robust, context-aware schema generation:
- **Conversation Management:** Maintaining context through message history
- **Schema Generation Pipeline:** Converting requirements to structured schemas
- **Format Detection:** Intelligent SQL vs NoSQL format selection
- **Error Handling:** Fallback mechanisms for AI failures
- **Prompt Engineering:** Carefully crafted prompts for consistent results

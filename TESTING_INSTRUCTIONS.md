# Testing the Fixed Forgot Password Functionality

This document provides instructions for testing the fixed forgot password functionality.

## What Was Fixed

The main issues that were fixed:

1. Fixed duplicate `mockHashPassword` function in `auth.ts`
2. Resolved type errors related to the password hashing function
3. Made sure all imports and usages of the function are consistent throughout the codebase

## Manually Testing the Flow

### 1. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test the Forgot Password Flow in the Browser

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/login
2. Click on "Forgot password?" link
3. Enter an email address (e.g., test@example.com)
4. Submit the form
5. You should see a success message

### 3. Check for the Reset Link

- If `RESEND_API_KEY` is configured: Check the email inbox for the password reset link
- If `RESEND_API_KEY` is not configured: Check the terminal/console output for a message containing the reset link (for development purposes)

### 4. Test the Reset Password Page

1. Access the reset password page with the token from step 3
2. Enter a new password and confirm it
3. Submit the form
4. You should be redirected to the login page
5. Try logging in with the new password

## Testing with the Test Script

We've created a simple test script to verify the core functionality:

```bash
# First install dependencies
npm install -g node-fetch

# Run the test script
node --input-type=module test-forgot-password.js
```

The script will:
1. Make a request to the forgot password API endpoint
2. Check if the request is successful 
3. Inform you where to find the reset link (logs or email)

## Expected Behavior

- The API should always return a success message regardless of whether the email exists (for security)
- If the email exists in the system, a reset token should be generated
- If Resend is configured, an email should be sent with the reset link
- If Resend is not configured, the link should be logged to the console
- The reset token should be valid for 1 hour

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the server logs for error messages
2. Verify your `.env.local` file has the correct configuration
3. Make sure the Resend API key is valid if you're testing with real email sending
